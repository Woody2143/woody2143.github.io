Links to me:
- See bottom of page.

Home:
- Married since '04.
- Two children, both boys.
- Wife is tolerant of my geeky ways as she enjoys the free technical support.

Social:
- Regularly attend the Monthly [Atlanta Perl Mongers](http://atlanta.pm.org) meeting
- Used to attend [Atlanta Unix Users Group](http://auug.org) meeting till it ended
- Used to attend [Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts](http://mail.ale.org), I really need to start going back
- Occasionally attend the Atlanta Javascript users group. Now that I don't work downtown I'm not sure I'll make it to those meetings again

Work History:
- Gainfully employed at a communications company for the past 15+ years.
  - Primary work is to troubleshoot VoIP issues
  - Secondary work is coming up with scripts/programs to make the job easier.

Editors:
- Long time user of VIM, though I can't say I use it to it's fullest.
  - I do make use of a few plugins though, like gitgutter
  - I'll have to share up my .vimrc (or dotfiles in general)

- Recently I've been using Atom as I've been working on javascript locally
  - I have the vim plugin installed. It's kind of weird but it keeps me from stumbling too much as I work between editors for a time.

Languages:
- Perl is my first love, though I don't write enough in it.
  - I mainly use Perl for server side processes on almost all of my internal work projects. I've written one app using Catalyst and another using Dancer and Moose.
    - I like Dancer better than Catalyst.

- Bash scripting as served me well for tying processes together. Though I feel guilty for not using Perl instead...
- I use awk for the terabytes of CSV files I manage, as much as I'd rather use Perl, awk is just plain faster for splitting CSV...
- I've been writing a lot more javascript as of late, specifically using AngularJS on a couple of work projects.
  - I've even gone so far as to actually write unit tests in Jasmine.
  - Working up to protractor.

Projects:
- Scripts (bash/awk/perl) that processes call detail records for the purposes of indexing and reports
- Scripts (bash/awk) that to transform/enrich CSV call records to something readable
- Several small CRUD type websites to track information in an effort to migrate away from spreadsheets (evil) and make the data accessible from other programs. Written using perl and javascript.
- Various scripts to help locate call records quicker.
- Website front ends to commandline tools

Goals:
- Get contributing to other projects
- Build up my public portfolio
- Learn, learn, learn.
