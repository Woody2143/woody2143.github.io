Here are the notes from the May meeting of the Atlanta Perl Mongers. I make no claims as to completion or accuracy. Updates welcome.

# Pre-Meeting
- [SouthEast Linux Fest](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/?p=2195) is coming up on Friday June 10th in Charlotte, NC.
- Show off my [https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-foot-switch/overview](USB foot switch).
  - Not super practical but has a "it's neat" factor (at least for me)
  - I'll have to put a link to my repo of the arduino code.
  - I plan on writing up a full post about the whole thing just to have some better documentation out there.
  - We discussed using voice commands for vi instead of a foot pedal.
- Discussion of the Harry Potter Theme Park
