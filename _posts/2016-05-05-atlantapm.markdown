Here are the notes from the May meeting of the Atlanta Perl Mongers. I make no claims as to completion or accuracy. Updates welcome.

# Pre-Meeting
- [SouthEast Linux Fest](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/?p=2195) is coming up on Friday June 10th in Charlotte, NC.
- Show off my [USB foot witch](https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-foot-switch/overview).
  - Not super practical but has a "it's neat" factor (at least for me)
  - I'll have to put a link to my repo of the arduino code.
  - I plan on writing up a full post about the whole thing just to have some better documentation out there.
  - We discussed using voice commands for vi instead of a foot pedal.
- Discussion of the Harry Potter Theme Park
- Util had to plug "[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)"

- Util Book Plugs
  - [Perl Best Practices](http://amzn.com/0596001738) useful as always
  - [Number Theory](http://amzn.com/0486682528) - A well written and different approach to teaching Number Theory
  - [Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking](http://amzn.com/0374112673) - picked up cause it looked interesting
  - [A Survival Guide to the Misinformation Age: Scientific Habits of Mind](http://amzn.com/0231168721) - also picked up like above

# Util YAPC talk - REDACTED
- You had to be here for this totally complete and well put together talk.
- Go see him talk at YAPC

- [Separating Programming Sheep from Non-Programming Goats](https://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/)
- [The Camel has Two Humps](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf)
  - [The draft of the paper is funny](https://web.archive.org/web/20070318023700/http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf)

- [Learning to Program](http://onfoodandcoding.blogspot.com/2013/03/learning-to-program.html)

- [Programming by poking: why MIT stopped teaching The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://www.posteriorscience.net/?p=206)
  - [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4hu9e4/programming_by_poking_why_mit_stopped_teaching/)
    - This caught my eye: [the futile art of programming by coincidence](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence)

- God has a Github account: [https://github.com/god?tab=repositories](https://github.com/god?tab=repositories)
  - I don't see any [LISP](https://xkcd.com/224/) though
  - ![XKCD Lisp](/assets/xkcd_lisp.jpg)

# Dinner Chat
- Got talking about different bits of comedy:
  - Alton Browns Eat Your Science! was a blast at the Fox Theature.
  - [Funny bit of one-liners](https://youtu.be/Ej8EaLF382c)
  - [Brian Regan - Hearing Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boMunBlKAVg)
  - [Brian Regan - Black Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87QYajKxPn4)
  - [Bill Cosby - Parenting/Grandparents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5jKKN5v6yA)
  - [Modern Seinfeld](https://twitter.com/seinfeldtoday?lang=en)

- Talked a little about goal tracking.
  - [Don't Break the Chain](http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem)
  - A creation of Jerry Seinfelds.
    - Least that's what most people believe. Util shared that someone finally got around to asking Seinfeld about it and he hadn't heard of it before but thought it sounded like a good idea.

- In case you were looking for something to listen to: (Software Engineering Podcasts Review)[http://blog.idempotent.ca/2016/04/28/software-engineering-podcasts-review/]
  - [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4hycnz/software_engineering_podcasts_review/) that lead me to the above.

- Guess there is an O'Reilly Book Cover generator out there as there have been a lot of posts on [/r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) with different covers. It's been a bit run in to the ground but there are some funny ones like below:
