Still trying to sort out using jekyll to manage this page.

# Initial Notes:
- Some of the same markdown that can be used in README.md in my repos doesn't render the same on these pages
- Need to add a hook to prebuild before commiting to catch build errors
- May point 2143.net at this page since it currently isn't doing anything but hosting my email
- Took the time to add my linkedIn and Google Plus contact info in the footer
  - Never messed with svg icons like that before. Had to copy them from [http://codepen.io/adamaoc/pen/hoKBq?editors=110](http://codepen.io/adamaoc/pen/hoKBq?editors=110)
  - Also had to mess with sass for the first time to get the column width adjusted in the footer.

- I'm not totally sold on the site title yet, but we'll see.

# Update 2015-12-07
- Found this page that gives some good ideas for adding things to a Github page.
