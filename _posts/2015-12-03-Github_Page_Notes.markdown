Still trying to sort out using jekyll to manage this page.
- Some of the same markdown that can be used in README.md in my repos doesn't render the same on these pages
- Need to add a hook to prebuild before commiting to catch build errors
- May point 2143.net at this page since it currently isn't doing anything but hosting my email
