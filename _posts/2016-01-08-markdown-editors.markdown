I decided to look around at some different markdown editors just to see what was out there.

- [remarkable](https://remarkableapp.github.io/)
  - locally installed, linux only
  - not in the repo so had to download the rpm
  - looks ok; the buttons are a big big and bright
  - Ultimately it didn't really strike me as something I wanted to use

- [retext](https://github.com/retext-project/retext)
  - locally installed, linux only
  - in the repo so easy to install
  - looks a bit worse than remarkable
  - again, just not what I would find myself using

- [atom](https://atom.io/)
  - locally installed; windows, linux, mac
  - in repo so easy to install
  - looks good, lots of features, plugins, etc
    - [markdown writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer)
    - plugin for writing/formatting markdown
    - specifically handles tags/catagories/drafts/posts
    - not perfect but better than anything else so far
  - I'll likely continue to use this

- [prose.io](http://prose.io/)
  - online editor
  - hooks directly in to github
    - that's fine if you are good with giving it permission to all of your repos
  - very clean looking, saves directly as commits
  - I really like this one as I can bring it up in chrome on my phone and edit posts directly there
    - really it'd be nice to be able to edit directly from any computer I'm on period
  - Not sure I'd use it full time though, still feels like it's missing something

- [haroopad](https://pad.haroopress.com)
  - Found this one listed on a few sites.
    - Good page to look at: [Tools to support your markdown authoring](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring)
  - Cross platform
  - Looks nice
    - windows installed easily enough
    - debian only package.
  - More testing to come...

- [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)
  - online editor
  - you can save directly to github, dropbox, google drive, one drive
  - only just happened to come across this, but it looks good
  - after some quick tests I don't believe it will work well for my github.io posts but it does seem nice for general editing.
