So the holidays went by pretty fast and I kept busy enough without having to try to write blog posts. It's a habit I have to work on...

I wanted to note down a few things I read/saw today (mainly via Reddit):

# Testing AngularJS:
- A good intro; wish I would have had it earlier
  - [Not testing your Angular code? Here's how to start](https://daveceddia.com/testing-angular-part-1-karma-setup/)
  - Video here: [https://vimeo.com/150441324](https://vimeo.com/150441324)
  - In the comments someone mentions ngDescribe. It cuts down on all the boilerplate needed to write tests in angular.
    - [Github Repo](https://github.com/kensho/ng-describe)
    - [How-To Use](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/1-2-3-tested/)

- Some sites I've used recently while working on writing tests for an angularjs app
  - [http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/09/advanced-testing-and-debugging-in-angularjs.html](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/09/advanced-testing-and-debugging-in-angularjs.html)
  - I just got looking at my bowser windows; I got a lost more to write here, just not right now...

# Material Design
- Google has a design specification called 'Material Design'.
  - A package for Angular was put out that makes it easy to code your web page to that specification.
  - I've not had a chance to dive in too much; but it looks like a replacement for Bootstrap.
  - There is a nice writeup that talks aboue Material Design and Angular Materials here: [http://onehungrymind.com/reasons-to-love-angular-material/](http://onehungrymind.com/reasons-to-love-angular-material/)

# Things about Reading
- The Pomodoro Technique
  - I have this as an ebook and started in to it but recently found it on Audible and started to give it a listen while driving in to work.
  - The idea is that you break up your tasks in to ~25 minute chunks. The person who came up with it literally used a kitchen timer, set it, and focused on a task for that period of time and once done, took a break. Then sat back down and worked for another chunk of time.
  - That's the overly simplified mostly not correct version of what this book talks about. It has some interesting ideas and some data to back up those ideas.
  - A side note about listening, I heard it suggested that on books like this (ie not entertaining) play it back at ~1.5x speed. I have to say; that suggestion seems to be working for me as I usually find listening to those types of books very boring. More testing is required

- I was reading an article about Reading More and picked up one reading suggestion.
  - [5 principles that will help you read more - Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-principles-that-will-help-you-read-more-2016-1)
  - There seemed to be some good suggestions in there. I'll have to try to make notes as I read to see how/if it really enhances things for me.
  - How does one do this with ebooks, just not quite the same...
  - Which lead me to pick a book or two from Amazon
    - 'How to Read A Book'
      - Picked up the soft copy as well as the audio version.
      - Also picked up 'How to Speak How to Listen' as suggested by Amazon.

- How to be a Programmer
  - Came across this essay that had been converted to markdown and put on github
  - [https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
  - Basically saving this to read over later.
  - The comments on reddit were a bit back and forth on the usefulness/validity of this info

# Videos
- Suggested this playlist to a friend who is trying to get in to the world of VoIP
  - [Telephone Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08C86258934DD006)

- I like this guys training videos. I at least watch the intro one for AngularJS
  - [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg)

- At some point I'll come back to watch this as I tinker with electronics
  - [Engineering Tutorial: How To Use A Multimeter](http://www.shaungehring.com/software-blog//engineering-tutorial-how-to-use-a-multimeter)
