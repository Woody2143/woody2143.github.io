Here are the notes from the April meeting of the Atlanta Perl Mongers. I make no claims as to completion or accuracy. Updates welcome.

# Hey, what happened to March?!?
- I gave a talk and took some notes, but never got around to writing up the post.
- My talk kicked ass; you should be ashamed you missed it.
  - LINK TO TALK

# Pre-Meeting
- Trailer for [Rogue One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg) looks pretty good. :)
- Talked about my (mis)adventures in C programming
  - Doing BCD (Binary Coded Decmile) reading/writing
  - character arrays are being overwritten
  - Mike/Stephen: Look at the symbol table
  - Debug it
- Also talked some about my adventures in threads
  - ADD LINKS Here
  - Stephen: Sounds like something map reduce would be good for
- Stephen had a question about something he was working on
  - I had started writing this and completely missed the question
  - AoH vs HoH?
- Mike [Variable::Magic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Variable::Magic) is Magic!
  - May give a talk on it in a future date.

# Util gives a talk - Concurrency in Perl 6
- [Perl 6 Documentation](https://doc.perl6.org/language/concurrency)
- In Perl 5 you do concurrency based on the way the module you are using does it (POE)
- Yeah; don't plan on me taking great notes here.
- mdw: ncdu (not sure why I wrote this bit)
- And here is where I fell down on the job and am writing this a month later...

# Dinner Chat
- There is a Perlbrew for Rakudo: [https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew](https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew)
- Talked a bit about my fun with threads and the need to try forks.
- I may have written more down but I've misplaced my notes...
