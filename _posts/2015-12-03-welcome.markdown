Figure I'll try my hand at posting up on my github page since it's available. I've been meaning to write more about the things I'm working on code wise. At the very least it'll help me keep track of some notes and I might actually take the time to understand things better if I have to explain it.

This is my first time using jekyll and I've not written much of anything in markdown either. But the markdown plugin I'm using with Atom is nice and keeps things mostly looking decent.
